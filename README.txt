Project built based on this video by Lea Verou https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnUDTtOLE0
It uses HTML and CSS, including SVG.

How do you do pizza charts? There's plenty of techniques available, and you can check them in this project and in the video!

A HEADS-UP ABOUT MY GITHUB ACCOUNT

Since at my job I use a different github account, I currently find more practical to start and update personal projects at my CodePen ( http://codepen.io/andreaweb/ ). I will deff commit more and more in this github account, but for the moment it'll happen mostly at weekends and the occasional holiday. It'll happen EVERY weekend though!

I also wanna be more active in the community and collaborate in other projects. If you think I can be useful, please e-mail me at return.santana@gmail.com

Thanks!
